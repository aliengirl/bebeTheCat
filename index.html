						<h3 id="heading3">Interesting Facts About the Exotic Shorthair:</h3>
						<ol>
						<li>The Exotic Shorthair came about by mixing a <strong>Persian</strong> with an <strong>American Shorthair.</strong> While the Exotic Shorthair possesses a very Persian temperament, being docile and sweet, this breed is a bit more adventurous and playful due to its American Shorthair lineage. </li>
						<li>Much like the Persian, the Exotic is an affectionate breed. These cats are quiet and don't demand attention. The Exotic will stare at their hooman lovingly!</li>
						<li>Unlike your average cat, the Exotic is not as independent. The Exotic cat loves to be with their hoomans and does not like to be left alone!</li>
